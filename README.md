## Building the project

#### 1. Get the source code - `git clone git@github.com:agaman1792/simple-backend.git`

#### 2. Install dependencies - `npm install`

#### 3. Create the environment file

Before running the server, adjust the environment variables to fit your setup, by creating the `.env` file, using the template `.env.example` file in the project's root directory.
We are doing this in order to protect sensitive data from being saved to source control

#### 4. Start the application - `npm start`

Run `npm install` in a terminal window
